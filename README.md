### Project Overview
---

An analysis of gender in the workplace offers important insights into the understanding of gender inequalities, especially in terms of access to resources, opportunities, limitations, and power within the professional setting. This project aims to guide the creation of policies, programs, and initiatives focused on addressing gender disparities at work. The objective is to pinpoint strategies that can improve employee productivity and overall business performance within the organization.

### Data Sources
---

The primary dataset for this analysis is sourced from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wrucebaynebot/hr-dataset) and includes information about the company's employees.

### Project Tools 
---

- **Language:** Python - Data Cleaning, Analysis, Reports. 
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

### Project Process

#### Data Preparation 

During the data preparation stage, the following tasks were completed: 

1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data Cleaning
     - Checking for duplicated values.
     - Formatting rows and columns.
     - Replacing and regrouping values.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

I conducted an exploratory data analysis to delve deeper into the following:

1. Gender representation in the company.
2. Gender disparities in accessibility to resources and opportunities within the organization.
3. Gender disparities in performance and overall satisfaction of employees.
4. Gender disparities in accessibility to power.

#### Findings
1. The gender distribution of employees in the organization is 60% male and 40% female. This 3:2 ratio indicates that for every three male employees, there are only two female employees.
2. There are gender disparities in accessibility to resources and opportunities. For example, female employees tend to earn more than their male counterparts.
3. Although male employees earn less than their female counterparts, they tend to express higher levels of job satisfaction.
4. The average job levels in R&D and Sales are consistent across genders, with a balanced stock option distribution, but females have higher job levels in Human Resources, showing some departmental variations.

#### Recommendations

1. Perform regular audits to assess gender representation, job level distribution, and pay equity across all departments.
2. Develop programs that support the career advancement of the underrepresented genders in departments with notable disparities.
3. Develop a process that will help mitigate unconscious bias in the promotion process. Also, the criteria for promotion should be equally accessible to all. 
4. Provide equal access to professional development opportunities and encourage participation across all departments, especially in departments where gender disparities are evident.
5. Promote a culture of inclusion and diversity through training and create a support network for underrepresented groups.
6. Review their recruitment practices and implement strategies that will help them attract a diverse pool of candidates.
7. Set measurable goals that are transparent for reducing gender disparities and regularly report on progress to all stakeholders.
